# AGENTIC AI for Personalized Course Pathways

Choosing the right learning path can be overwhelming for students due to the vast and unstructured nature of online courses, tutorials, and resources. Many students lack personalized guidance aligned with their interests, current skill level, and long-term goals. As a result, they often feel lost, follow inconsistent paths, or waste time on irrelevant content.

CareerHelper is an agentic AI coach developed using IBM watsonx.ai and Granite LLM, designed to guide students in selecting personalized learning pathways. By interacting with users in natural language, it understands their areas of interest (e.g., Frontend Development, Cybersecurity, UI/UX, AI) and current knowledge level. Based on this, it dynamically generates a step-by-step learning roadmap, complete with topic recommendations, explanations, and study strategies. This intelligent assistant empowers learners to make informed decisions and stay on a consistent, goal-aligned path.
